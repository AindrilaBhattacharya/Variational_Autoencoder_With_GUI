# Variational_Autoencoder_With_GUI

This is a Variational Autoencoder which trains using the Labelled Faces in the Wild Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset)

After training on this, it generates a model by the name of vae_lfw.pth.

This model is then attached to the GUI which allows the user to reconstruct a face based on six latent variables, which can be controlled using sliders.
